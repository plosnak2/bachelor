serves to facilitate work of coaches to communicate with their athletes and clients. It is
a mobile chat with which coaches are able to provide adequate feedback to their athletes
during training. Beginners in area of exercising are able to better understand how to perform
each exercise and how they can minimize mistakes during exercising. The application also
